  > His philosophical ideas were affected by Franz Brentano,[37] with whom he had studied,[61] as well as by Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, and Goethe's phenomenological approach to science.[37][62][63] , Steiner used the word Geisteswissenschaft (from Geist = mind or spirit, Wissenschaft = science), a term originally coined by Wilhelm Dilthey as a descriptor of the humanities, in a novel way, to describe a systematic ("scientific") approach to spirituality.[64] Steiner used the term Geisteswissenschaft, generally translated into English as "spiritual science," to describe a discipline treating the spirit as something actual and real, starting from the premise that it is possible for human beings to penetrate behind what is sense-perceptible.
