## Estilos para layers

[stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/25023/can-i-change-style-properties-of-several-layers-simultaneously)

> If you save the style options for the one vector layer as a .qml file, you can apply it onto multiple layers at once with the MultiQML-plugin. Basically, it's an interface window that lets you select which layers you want the style to apply to (by hand, or 'select all'), the 'apply style' button lets you select the qml with the style info.
